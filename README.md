# The Zipper Hashouts Project #

## License ##

Anything in the doc/ directory is licensed under the license found [in this linked document](./license.txt). 

This license usage is a bit of an experiment. The aim is to require commercial use of the concepts and ideas outlined in this project to need a commercial license.

Ideally this will be given through the purchase of Zipper Hashouts blockchain tokens according to requirements of the commercial license rather than paying a central entity.

The license in use is mashup of License Zero Noncommercial Public License and the FreeBSD Documentation License.

## How to contribute ## 

If you're an individual wanting to contribute, please print+sign+scan [this linked document](./cla_individual.pdf) and send it to cla@zipperglobal.com along with your GitHub username and after that we'll accept your merge requests :)

Same procedure if you're an entity (a company, etc.), but use [this linked document](./cla_entity.pdf) instead.

We will have having click-wrap agreements later on so we don't have to kill half a tree to sign an agreement.

tl;dr you need to give Zipper Global Ltd. a copyright license to relicense your contributions to Hashouts as it sees fit; as long as the contribution is also licensed under the license the documentation, or software, is under.

Ideally we'll move this to specify implicitly that there should be maintained a license of the software by which commercial use will yield a purchase of Zipper Hashouts tokens.
